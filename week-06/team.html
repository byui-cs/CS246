        <h2>06 Team : Risk Mitigation</h2>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Attempt to mitigate the risks identified last week.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Risk Mitigation</h3>
        <p>This week, for your team project, you need to do the research or proof of concept work that you identified last week to help mitigate the biggest risks to your project. This does not mean that you have to finish the entire project this week, but rather that you should become more familiar with pieces that were previously unknown.</p>

        <p>The goal is that by the end of this week, you can verify that there is a way to accomplish the task at hand, and you have a basic idea of how to go about it. Then, we will spend the rest of the semester building out the complete projects using these ideas.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>The risk mitigation report should be pretty simple. Something along the lines of:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <h4>Risk Mitigation Report for Team 06</h4>

        <p>Risk 1. Our application will require storing data in the cloud, and none of us have any experience working with cloud storage.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Update:</strong> John gave a great report about this and we feel pretty confident that we'll be able to use Google Firestore to solve this problem. John is going to take the lead on this and continue to get up to speed with some online tutorials he found.</p>

        <p>2. Our application requires users to log in to a secure system and post photos of their cats. None of us have ever worked with user authentication before, and none of us have a cat.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Update:</strong> We actually found a stray cat behind the apartment building we can use. We debated the pros and cons of the authentication methods Steve researched and decided to use Google's authentication APIs that are built into Firebase. Steve is going to put together a quick prototype of how this would work.</p>

        <p>3. We're planning on adding some location-aware features, but none of us have experience with the location APIs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Update:</strong> Sally finished her prototype early and it's ready to drop into the app once we reach that point.</p>

        <p>4. etc...</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>Submit one document per team listing each risk identified last week, the steps that were taken to mitigate that risk, and briefly summarize what you learned.</p>
