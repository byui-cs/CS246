            <li><p>Understand how to deserialize JSON into objects and collections.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <h4>Part I: Understanding JSON</h4>
        <p>JSON is a data storage format originally developed for web applications. It has become one of the most popular data exchange formats because of its compact size and readability. (Another popular data format is XML. If you're interested, you can read more about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4862511/28106">the pros and cons of the two here</a>.)</p>

        <p>Here is what an array looks like in JSON:</p>

<pre><code class="json">// Array of numbers 
[ 1, 2, 3, 4]

// Array of strings
[ "mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat", "sun"]

// Array of booleans:
[ true, false, true, true]
</code></pre>

        <p>JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation". Even though we can use it to store simple arrays, it's designed to allow complex objects to be stored in key-value pairs.</p>
        <p>The keys are strings that correspond to the property names, and the values are the values of the property for a particular object:</p>

<pre><code class="java">// Player object 
Player p = new Player();
p.setName("Steve");
p.setHealth(20);
p.setMana(50);
p.setCanFly(false);
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="json">// JSON Representation 
{ "name": "Steve", "health": 20, "mana": 50, "canFly": false}
</code></pre>

        <p>We can take an object, <em>serialize</em> into JSON, and then share that data, (either in a file or by sending it over the network. Then we can <em>deserialize</em> it back into an object.</p>

        <h4>Part II: Create a Project with the GSON Library</h4>
        <p>Unfortunately, Java doesn't have built-in support for JSON, so to parse it we have to use a 3rd party library. There are several available, but we'll be using <a href="https://github.com/google/gson">Google's GSON library</a> (GSON just stands for "Google JSON", it isn't a different data format).</p>

        <p>We'll be using a pre-compiled <em>jar</em> version of the library. A <em>jar</em> file is like a zip file containing a bunch of compiled java classes. It's how java programs and libraries are typically shared.</p>

        <p>Maven is a popular place to store 3rd party libraries. IntelliJ can load libraries directly from Maven pretty easily.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>To begin, create a new command line project in IntelliJ.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After the project loads, add the GSON library from Maven. If you're not sure how to do this, you might need to google: <em>intellij add library from maven</em> and look at the official docs on the JetBrains website.</p>
                <p>You should use the most recent version of GSON, at this time, that is: <em>com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.0</em>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Test that the library has been installed correctly by trying to use the <code>Gson</code> class in <code>main()</code> and making sure it compiles without errors:</p>
<pre><code class="java">package teach03;

import com.google.gson.Gson;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Gson g = new Gson();
    }
}
</code></pre>
                <p>If you got an error, about not being able to find the Gson library, you'll need to go back to step 2 and try to add it again.</p>             
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Part III: Use the GSON library.</h4>
        <p>With the GSON library installed, it's now time to try serializing and deserializing some things.</p>
        <p>Note that this part will be a bit difficult, as I'm leaving many of the details up to you to figure out.</p>
        <p>You may want to refer to the <a href="https://futurestud.io/tutorials/gson-getting-started-with-java-json-serialization-deserialization">GSON tutorials here</a> as you go through the rest of this assignment.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create a class definition for a class called <code>Player</code> that has properties for name, health, mana, and gold.</p>
                <p>You might also want to add some kind of display function you can use to easily show those values.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a class called <code>Game</code> that will take an instance of the <code>Player</code> class in its constructor and store it in a member variable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a function in the <code>Game</code> class called <code>saveGame()</code> that will use the GSON library to serialize the object to a string, and save that string to a file.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add a <em>static</em> function to the <code>Game</code> class that takes a filename as a String and returns a new <code>Game</code> generated from the data in that file.</p>
                <p>This function should load the file contents as a String, then use the GSON library to deserialize it into a new Player class, create a new <code>Game</code> instance with that player, then return the new game instance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In <code>main()</code>, create an instance of the <code>Player</code> class, and populate its values. Then, create a new instance of the <code>Game</code> class, passing the player you created to its constructor. Then call the <code>saveGame()</code> method. Verify the save file contains the correct JSON data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use the <em>static</em> function of the <code>Game</code> class you created in order to create a second <code>Game</code> object, passing in the filename you used in the previous step. Verify that the <code>Player</code> object contained in the new game has been loaded correctly. Its values should match those of the original.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Once you've made it this far, move on the stretch challenge.</p>
        <h4 class="stretch">🌟Stretch Challenge🌟</h4>
        <p>Let's allow our player to have some equipment.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Add a <code>Map</code> called <code>equipment</code> to the <code>Player</code> class that will map equipment names as Strings to equipment costs as Integers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Modify <code>main()</code> so that it will add some equipment to the <code>Player</code> instance before passing it to the <code>Game</code> constructor. Make sure you're following good rules of encapsulation here and not acessing the <code>Map</code> directly from <code>main()</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Verify that you can still serialize and deserialize the complete <code>Player</code> object (including euqipment), and if not, modify your code as needed to make it work.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Congratulations! You now know how to serialize an deserialize with JSON.</p>
        <p>Make sure everyone on your team understands and receives a copy of this code.</p>
