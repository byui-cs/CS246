        <h2>0.4 :: Code Conventions and Style</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>An important component of software development, especially when working with others, is learning to use a consistent programming style. This is especially important when multiple developers are contributing to the same codebase.</p>

        <p>Using a consistent style in a project provides the following benefits:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>It will help developers to navigate through the code more quickly.</p></li>
            <li><p>It helps you to spot errors.</p></li>
            <li><p>It reduces the cost of code maintenance</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Style Guides</h3>
        <p>Most languages have a generally accepted style guide for that language. In addition, many companies have their own software style guides. Learning to follow a style guide is an important skill.</p>

        <p>In this course, we will use one of the most popular style guides for Java programming, <a href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html">the Google Java Style guide.</a></p>
        
        <p>This style is likely different than what you're used to using when programming in C++. For example, it uses the &ldquo;K &amp; R style&rdquo; of braces (Style Rule 4.1.2), where the opening brace appears on the same line as the method name or if statement:</p>
<pre><code class="java">if (expression) {
   statement;
   statement;
}
</code></pre>
        <p>Please take some time to become familiar with <a href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html">the style guide</a>, especially the formatting requirements from section 4.</p>
