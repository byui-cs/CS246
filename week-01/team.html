        <h2>01 Team : First Thoughts Pitch</h2>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Begin brainstorming ideas for a team project.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Team Projects</h3>
        <p>The majority of this semester will be spent working in teams developing a real project for a real sponsor. Part of your responsibility is to find a sponsor and a project to work on. It will be turned in as your final during the last week of class. You will be expected to show consistent progress through a series of deliverable milestones.</p>
        <p>This week, you need to start talking to people around you (neighbors, bosses, co-workers, family members, etc.) to see what ideas you can find, and then give a “pitch” for one of these ideas in the #general channel on Slack.</p>
        <p>This is not a commitment that you will have to work on this project nor that your contact is committing to be a sponsor, but rather a chance to have a little bit of a group brainstorming project and to help as we will be forming teams around ideas next week.</p>
        <p>Remember to keep these very brief and to the point. A sentence or two or a few bullet points should be sufficient.</p>

        <ol class='checklist'>
            <li><p>Read through <a href="https://byui-cs.github.io/CS246/team-project/overview.html">the Team Project Overview</a> to get an idea of what kinds of projects would fit for this course.</p></li>
            <li><p>Post your idea for a team project on Slack in the #general channel.</p></li>
        </ol>
