        <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <h4>Part I: Install and Configure the Java JDK</h4>
        <p>Before continuing, you should have completed this week's <a href="./prepare.html">preparation assignment</a>.</p>

        <p>First, we need to install the Java SDK and configure your system to use it. Please follow the instructions in the video that corresponds to your operating system.</p>
        
        <p>Windows 10</p>

        <p>Windows 8/8.1</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pb-r8U2kpCU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>macOS</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GNBzU4n7Okc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>Once you have the JDK successfully installed, move on to Part II.</p>

        <h4>Part II: Install the IntelliJ IDE</h4>

        <p>While we could now write and compile Java code on the command line, most modern software developers use IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) for these tasks.</p>

        <p>There are several Java IDEs available. We'll be using the IntelliJ IDE because it will allow us to create regular Java and Android projects.</p>
        
        <p>To begin, download and install the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">free, Community edition of IntelliJ</a>.</p> 

        <h4>Part III: Write a Java Hello World program</h4>

        <p>With your system configured, you're ready to write your first Java program. Here are the guidelines to follow:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>If you haven't already, make sure you review the <a href="../welcome/style.html">Course Style Guide</a> to see how Java code should be styled for this course.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p>Launch IntelliJ and select "Create a New Project".</p>
                <p>Select "Java" from the project types on the left-side of the window, make sure the Java SDK version you downloaded is selected at the top, and then click "Next".</p>
                <img class="screenshot-xlarge" src="./img/ij1.png"/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Check the "Create project from template box", select "Command Line App" from the template list, and click "Next".</p>
                <img class="screenshot-xlarge" src="./img/ij2.png"/>
            </li>
             <li>
                <p>Fill in the project settings. What you enter here isn't too critical, but a good guideline is to name your projects after the assignment number (e.g. this one would be "teach-01").</p>
                <p>You can set your base package name to either be your last name or the name of the project without spaces (e.g. "HelloWorld").</p>
                <p>Once you've entered the values, click "Next".</p>
                <img class="screenshot-xlarge" src="./img/ij3.png"/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Wait a few moments while the project loads, and if everything went well, you should see a new project loaded with a class called <code>Main</code> that is pre-populated with the <code>main()</code> method.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Find the line that says: <code>public class Main {</code>. Rename the class to <code>HelloWorld</code></p>
                <p>After you do so, you should see a red, squiggly line appear under the class definition. This line indicates there is an error in the code. Hover your mouse over the line to see the error.</p>
                <img class="screenshot-xlarge" src="./img/error.png"/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In this case, the error is warning us that a public class must be defined in a file with the same name.</p>
                <p>Click anywhere on the line where the red squiggle appears and press <code>Alt+Enter</code> (or <code>Option+Enter</code> on OX X).</p>
                <p>A list of possible solutions to this error appear. Select the action that says "Rename File". The file will be renamed to <em>HelloWorld.java</em>, and the error indicator should disappear.</p>
                <img class="screenshot-large" src="./img/resolve.png"/>
                <p>This same pattern (hover over squiggly line to see error then click on line and press <code>Alt+Enter</code> to see possible fixes) can often be used in IntelliJ for resolving common problems.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add another method to the the HelloWorld class called <code>sayHello()</code>. This method should print "Hello World" to the console.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Have <code>main()</code> create a new instance of the HelloWorld class and call its <code>sayHello()</code> method. This is all that <code>main()</code> should do.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Try to compile and execute your code by clicking on the green play button in the upper-right hand corner of the window.</p>
                <img class="screenshot" src="./img/run.png"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, this will fail with a runtime error stating that it can't find the class called <code>Main</code>. Since we renamed the class that has our <code>main()</code> method, we need to tell the IDE which class it should look in.</p>
                <img class="screenshot-xlarge" src="./img/runtime-error.png"/>
                <p>To do so, click on the Select Configuration button in the top, right-hand corner of the screen, just to the left of the Run button.</p>
                <img class="screenshot" src="./img/edit-config1.png"/>
                <p>In the menu that appears, select "Edit Configurations...".</p>
                 <img class="screenshot" src="./img/edit-config-menu.png"/>
                <p>You'll see a window appear that contains settings for how to run our program. The setting we're interested in is the one for the Main class.</p>
                <img class="screenshot-xlarge" src="./img/edit-config2.png"/>
                <p>Change the part in red that says <code>Main</code> to <code>HelloWorld</code> to match the name of the class with the <code>main()</code> function in it. Then click "OK".</p>
                <img class="screenshot-xlarge" src="./img/edit-config3.png"/>
            </li>     
            <li>
                <p>Now click the Run button again, and if all goes well, you should see the text "Hello World" displayed in the output console at the bottom of the window.</p>
                <img class="screenshot-xlarge" src="./img/output.png"/>
        </ol>

        <p>Once you've finished, or if you get stuck, compare your code to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/lfalin/eb3bf9ea46725f882a54d14d6b667f81">teacher's solution</a>.

        <h4 class="stretch">🌟Stretch Challenge🌟</h4>
        <p>Now that you can write simple Java programs, it's time to make something useful. Write a program that asks the user for the radius of a circle, then have it print the area and circumference rounded to two decimal places.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
               <p>Before you begin, you should read the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberformat.html">Formatting Numeric Output</a></li>
                        <li><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~hasti/cs368/JavaTutorial/NOTES/JavaIO_Scanner.html">How to use Java's Scanner class to get user input.</a></li>
                    </ul>
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a public class called <code>CircleCalculator</code> and save it in a <em>.java</em> file with the same name.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add a function to the class called <code>getRadius()</code> that gets the radius from the user as a float.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add a function to the class called <code>displayCircumference()</code> that takes the radius as a parameter, calculates the circumference, and displays it to two decimal places.</p>
            </li>
             <li>
                <p>Add a function to the class called <code>displayArea()</code> that takes the radius as a parameter, calculates the circumference, and displays it to two decimal places.</p>
            </li>
             <li>
                <p>As before, have <code>main()</code> create an instance of the class. Then call the instance's <code>getRadius()</code>, <code>displayCircumference()</code>, and <code>displayArea()</code> methods.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Congratulations! You now know how to write, compile, and run basic Java programs.</p>
        <p>Make sure everyone on your team understands and receives a copy of this code.</p>
